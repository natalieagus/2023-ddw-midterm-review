# Write a Python function called calculate_factorial that takes an integer n as its argument and returns the factorial of that number.
# The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It is denoted as n!.
# For example, calculate_factorial(5) should return 120 because 5! is equal to 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, which is 120.


def calculate_factorial(n):
    pass


# Test the function
print(calculate_factorial(5))  # Output should be 120
