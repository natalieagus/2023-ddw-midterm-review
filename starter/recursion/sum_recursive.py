# Write a Python function called recursive_sum that takes a list of integers as its argument and returns the sum of all the elements in the list using recursion.
# For example, recursive_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) should return 15 because the sum of these elements is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5, which is 15.


def recursive_sum(lst):
    pass


# Test the function
print(recursive_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output should be 15
